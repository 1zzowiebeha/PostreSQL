Hi, I would like to request a few documentation improvements regarding the join tutorial.
In the last few paragraphs, it's said that the reader will encounter queries that omit the AS keyword, and
	recommends this practice in order to save characters.

However, according to the select documentation for alias (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-select.html),
and also under the "Omitting the AS Key Word" section, it says that AS is required if you wish
to avoid name collisions for keywords, and that it is recommended practice to include it.

"As a general rule, if you get spurious parser errors for commands that use any of the
listed key words as an identifier, you should try quoting the identifier to see if the problem goes away"
(https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-keywords-appendix.html)

Since omitting AS can lead to naming conflicts, would it be helpful in this tutorial to recommend the best
practices? (and reference the explaining documentation)

I also would like to suggest mentioning that [OUTER] is an optional keyword.
It is common for OUTER to indicate selecting unrelated values of a table, whereas omitting the keyword 
is used to indicate selecting all values of a table, related or not.
Including this would be very helpful to us readers!

Thank you,

Zowie
