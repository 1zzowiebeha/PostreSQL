GROUP BY essentially allows grouping of Aggregate Functions (functions that act on entire columns)
and of normal columns. It allows you to combine (group) these aggregate columns, and place them next to
other columns you select, all in a single selection.


Nope ^


GROUP BY allows the selection of distinct columns
and columns of these groups to be paired with Aggregate Functions
into a singular table output.

Proof:

-- selects distinct companies, which are groups that can be paired with agg functions.
select company
from products
group by company;


All columns selected must either be included in GROUP BY, or they must be
paired with Aggregate Functions.

WHERE filters before the columns are aggregated.
HAVING filters after the columns are aggregated.

SELECT typewriter_brand,
 AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM typewriter_products
GROUP BY typewriter_brand;

This query groups data by the typewriter brand,
and calculates the average price of all rows in the group.
